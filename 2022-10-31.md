I am under the assumption that ***EPH-20 ( 10,10,...

Ok, time for another admission or two. The published EPH20 mix is 11.6 LN, 11.6 LH, 5 NC, 5 GG. The LN and LH need to be the same quantity for the chemical reaction that makes nitratohypophosphite. The NC provides extra power and the GG provides friction. EPH0 uses half as much GG as LN (40 LN, 40 LH, 20 GG). Early on I tried a "simplified" ratio of 10 LN, 10 LH, 5 NC, 5 GG that has the same GG to LN ratio as EPH0, but throws in the 5 NC for extra power. Compared to the published mix, it has a slightly higher fraction of NC (which adds power) and a slightly higher fraction of GG (which reduces power). It worked, and it is real easy to remember and to scale. Next admission is that I get each component fully processed into the right mesh separately and then I combine them in a batch that may be 40 LN, 40 LH, 20 NC, 20 GG. I then load say 300 primers and keep the left over mix for next session (I store it in a small plastic pill bottle with a tight fitting screw on lid). This is a hold over from when I first started and was not doing batches of 100 at a time. It worked for me then and I just kept doing it. The "make a batch and use it all at once" guidance was not in the Homemade Primer Course pdf that I used to get started and I was into a pretty settled routine before someone informed me that I was a rule breaker.

found the spreadsheet and $500+ is reasonable, let me know when you go into production.

Take a look at the sample post I made on the group page. I’ll do another run of plate sets soon. And you’ll see a post for that, at that point in time. Since I have to make production runs, I need to space out when I do it, so that there is enough participation in each run to make it possible. I’ll PM you the spreadsheet tomorrow if you can’t find it on the group
