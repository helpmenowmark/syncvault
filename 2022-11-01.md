New guys: you can ask any of the members for help either through this chat but if you will let us know a few days early - we can arrange to assist you with the lab. The lab is simple but because it's all new - it's plain ol' easier if you have phone support while you conduct the lab. We support you through either Zello or Zoom. Just ask.

Safely making the missing lin k:

A little bit has changed since I published Marshall's lab "Safely Making The Missing link". Keep the dry chemicals the same (but weigh them accurately). The reduce the water in the big beaker. Use 95 ml distilled water (big beaker) instead of the 150 ml called for in the recipe.

The water added to each beaker is somewhat of a range but 50 ml in the small beaker (with the lead nitrate) and 95 ml in the big beaker (sodium hypophosphite) works well.

Don't let the fancy names intimidate you. Chemists must be precise and that just happens to be the name(s) of the chemicals required for a impact sensitive primer compound.

There are many other primer recipes to choose from EPH 20 is the easiest to obtain/make and is noncorrosive. Only 4 simple ingredients and it works.

Watch the video but one more note:  
A common mistake I see being made rather often is not rinsing the material in the coffee filter enough. Once the product is made/synthesized it's actually quite insoluable (won't dissolve very easily) so you don't be reluctant to rinse the lab well. The instructions call for 3 good rinses. Don't be shy.

Other than that - have fun.

No your correct a 20" barrel. I agree on partial size. For my next batch I will reduce the size and test them against the same primer with larger particles.

If you see sparks in abundance coming out of the barrel - that tells me that the particles are large enough to survive the trip from the primer all the way down the barrel. I was thinking by reducing the size of the particles then they would do their job somewhere inside the ammo brass/barrel and not get "wasted" outside the barrel.

Oops - I thought you had a 20" barrel - so I have you mixed up with another member (I did not backtrack through history). The good news is the primer/titanium as a whole is functioning just fine.

Yeah I definitely had too much in it. I'm trying to figure out how much that should be and if I should change the rest of the mixture or just reduce the metal content. The upside to the titanium is the amount needed is less freeing space inside the cup. And once it burns it converts to titanium dioxide which is softer than titanium. So far there have been no issues with the barrel being worn down with the titanium primers. If I get a chance I will post a video of the sparks coming out of the barrel.

And as Mark indicated try to change only one thing at a time it will help in trouble shooting. I have also found keeping detailed written notes very helpful. I am experimenting with titanium also what appeals to me is titanium does not corrode to an oxide as aluminum does so shelf life may be much longer.

The .308 case was loaded fairly hot so a fireball is expected out of the short barrel. But even with the hotter load the titanium is still visible when burning. Meaning it is hotter than the smokeless powder when burning. That's why I was thinking of reducing the amount of metal in the mix. I will try a finer metal powder next batch to try. Just trying to find more room in the cup.

@Andrew I re-read you comment. Fire out of a barrel is normal but a fireball (especially a 20" barrel) is wasting powder. I pictured a lot of sparks amongst the flames when I made those comments. But let's change one thing at a time.

@Andrew Note: I am guessing here since I have no firsthand experience with titanium but 200 is a good starting point (and then go finer to 'say' 250/your next mesh down). Marshall hasn't made any corrective comments so that's good. Besides - it's not like we are on thin ice with this one.

You may ask for live support from our members. We can contact you via live phone call via zoom or zello.

Ask members if you have any questions.

The lab is trivial but I do recommend watching the lab video and asking questions of our members.

As Marshall states in his video - what you are making is not explosive in the least. During the lab you will find: nothing will boil over, no fumes, no smelly gases, no color changes, or anything like you may be visualizing. Using an eyedropper slows the whole process - giving the chemicals time to react. The chemicals are poisonous (contain lead) so wear gloves and eyewear and don't ingest them. The hot plates are indeed hot: water is heated but not quite up to boiling. It's as easy as wet chemistry gets.

I have made and tested a batch with the same weight and mesh in titanium and I was getting at least 6" of burning titanium out of a 20 inch barrel .308. Even when loaded the titanium was still burning at the end of the barrel. Makes me think the metal is not burning completely. So would that mean there is too much metal powder for the mix?

I was using varget with a slightly compressed load.

Marks thanks for the clarification. Now here is another idea I have been thinking about. I use titanium powder in place of aluminum. Same mesh size but it produces a much hotter spark. I agree on power but for slow burning powders the hotter spark lends itself well. If I was to reduce the amount of titanium in the mixture should I replace it with NC or increase the LN and LH amounts equally. The primers I make with the standard recipe and titanium powder can ring my ears and send sparks out the barrel.

.¬†¬† Per Marshall .. when you have " room" in the primer ('say' by leaving out some glass) then you should substitute with nc before adding more al (I¬† assume more power is the goal)

‚Äù

Expounding on your theory and assuming that you are correct -

If that ' small piece of metal ' was further reduced in size - say to a much finer mesh than 80 -100 - like for instance 325 mesh for the AL -

Would that not eliminate / reduce the potential for the FTF problem ?

I inquire because in the "¬†_**Primers for Small Arms Cartridges**_¬†" treatise by Albert and Oelberg , they stress the importance to reducing ALL compounds used in their various formulas to the consistency of finely ground flour.

Primer cups, especially the SPP and SRP cups, are extremely tiny and as a result hold a minimal quantity of compound.

My theory would be that a large size piece of AL would be comparable to a boulder on the beach, which is conducive to West Coast beaches but not East Coast beaches. ( Overreach but made for emphasis ).

Personally, I am not trying to ignite slow burning rifle powders, but seek to ignite fast pistol / shotshell powders, such as Nitro 100NF, Red Dot, Accurate No.2, Universal , HP-38, Auto-Comp and finally Long Shot.

I also have quantities of Win Clean 244 and Win 572, but are relegating my reloads to Red Dot ( 12 Ga ), Accurate No.2 ( pistol and revolver ) and Universal and LongShot (20 Ga.).

I am only reloading 9mm, 38 Spec, 357 Mag, 40 S&w, 45 ACP and 12 and 20 Ga shot and slugs.

I've had better reliability with eph20 but changing the ratio of ground glass to NC. I found a 3:1 ration NC:GG works best when grinding down raw gun powder. 4:1 has the same results but is much more effort than 3:1.

‚Äù

Before adding more ingredients to the same weight and mixture I think I would want to rule out all the other things both mechanical and technical. Too little water and not enough dry time will cause this problem. I think I would use the same compound added to a few more primer cups and add the water as you previously did but ensure a thorough soaking was accomplished, and secondly a thorough drying was acheived. Typical time to air dry can be two or three days with a well soaked compound. How much water was added and how much dry time did you allow before firing. Your compound worked before you added the same weight in NC ground to a finer consistency. So it should react he same all things being equal.

Marshall suggests only keeping a small amount of compound at a time at the bench in case of ignition. I use condiment cups and will always premix the larger container prior to adding it to the smaller container.

Did you thoroughly remix your primer compound before adding it to your primer cups. We have seen the compound settle out in layers from heavier denser particles in the bottom of the container to the lighter powder on top of the container. I have seen this first hand in my own compound.

NC was not harvested in the same manner. The first time I used acetone to melt the NC into a puck and grounded from there. This last time I used a flour grinder to grind it straight out of the bottle.

I am getting a delayed firing on my eph 25 being used in a 38. The only difference between this formula and the last formula the NC was ground much smaller the 2nd time. My 1st batch of eph 25 the NC was between 100-80 mesh, this time its between 200-100 mesh. The bang test gave a pretty good pop. So what more information do you need to be able to help me with this delayed firing?

Setting up your lab: the "Scavenger Hunt"

[https://www.aardvarkreloading.com/labequipment.html](https://www.aardvarkreloading.com/labequipment.html)

@new guys (and gal): Watch the associated movie for each item (just click). We try to steer you toward the most affordable (cheapest) equipment available.

Hot Plate Stirrer:  
Make sure it has two knobs. One is for the temperature and the other controls the stir rate. The two knob variety are better for control.

Beakers:  
Pay a few dollars more for pyrex brand (made out of borosilicate glass). You can save a few dollars by buying a set. At minimum get a 250 ml, and a 100ml (a 50ml is a nice-to-have)

Graduated cylinder:  
A plastic 10 ml graduated cylinder is fine. A 100 ml one is more convenient but the ones made out of glass are better.

Magnetic stir bars:  
Buy a set of assorted lengths. The two short ones (a half inch one or less) are commonly used. The long ones usually spin too fast.

Distilled water:  
Not tap water, not spring water, not fresh well-water, not water from a dehumidifier - buy distilled water. Go crazy and buy a gallon of it from Walmart for a dollar. It's important for a number of reasons. It works.

Coffee filter:  
The ol' fashion round 7.5 inch /13 cup paper ones cheap at the Dollartree or found at Walmart. Don't get fancy here. The size of the filter is good and they filter at the right rate. Only use 1. It works.

Eye Dropper:  
The 1 ml type are common. The size of the droplets are good. Don't overthink this. It works.

If funds are tight - ask private message Tom Allgaier and ask about the scavenger hunt lab equipment (Brandon Boxes).

Look the items over and watch the attached movies. Ask any member here if you have any questions.
