# Mortar and Pestle
Common mortar and pestles are made out of ceramics.

It may surprising to know that ceramics materials are porous.   Materials  ground in the mortar can become trapped in the pores.   Meaning the trapped material can inadvertantly come in contact with the next substance ground in the mortar. ^104fda
